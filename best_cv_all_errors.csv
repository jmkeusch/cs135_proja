0,amazon,Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.
4,amazon,None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.
22,amazon,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
23,amazon,We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros
24,amazon,Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.
27,amazon,Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.
35,amazon,In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.
39,amazon,"This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible."
41,amazon,This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.
42,amazon,Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.
43,amazon,This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
46,amazon,"If you are looking for a nice quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it."
47,amazon,"My father has the V265, and the battery is dying."
53,amazon,"I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The nice"
54,amazon,Excellent starter wireless headset.
61,amazon,I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.
69,amazon,I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.
72,amazon,"At first I thought I was grtting a nice deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr)."
76,amazon,doesn't last long.
79,amazon,Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
83,amazon,"Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk."
85,amazon,It doesn't make you look cool.
87,amazon,"I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while."
91,amazon,Unreliable - I'm giving up.
95,amazon,Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.
108,amazon,Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.
120,amazon,Everything about this product is wrong.First
122,amazon,After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.
123,amazon,Phone falls out easily.
127,amazon,The BT headset was such a disapoinment.
128,amazon,"I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great."
155,amazon,The commercials are the most misleading.
156,amazon,"Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack."
158,amazon,It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.
167,amazon,"While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop."
168,amazon,"The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution."
169,amazon,The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
183,amazon,You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.
188,amazon,Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory
192,amazon,This is infuriating.
193,amazon,"The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing."
194,amazon,It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
198,amazon,You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.
204,amazon,If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.
205,amazon,"I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything."
207,amazon,"The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked."
209,amazon,wont work right or atleast for me.
212,amazon,I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.
218,amazon,Kind of flops around.
219,amazon,The pleather case doesn't fit.
228,amazon,Very Dissapointing Performance.
230,amazon,"Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple."
232,amazon,"It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem."
234,amazon,Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.
238,amazon,They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
412,amazon,Plan on ordering from them again and again.
422,amazon,Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.
423,amazon,"i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced."
428,amazon,Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
440,amazon,The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
455,amazon,I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
466,amazon,It does everything the description said it would.
477,amazon,Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!
480,amazon,Battery charge-life is quite long.
485,amazon,"Five star Plus, plus."
491,amazon,Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.
509,amazon,Better than expected.
510,amazon,its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.
518,amazon,Someone shouldve invented this sooner.
521,amazon,"It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned."
533,amazon,I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
546,amazon,nice protection and does not make phone too bulky.
562,amazon,Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
564,amazon,"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."""
579,amazon,"Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place."
587,amazon,Its a total package.
595,amazon,So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
597,amazon,Magical Help.
602,amazon,much better than the hard plastic cases.
607,amazon,Better Than New.
630,amazon,"I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case."
243,amazon,"The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary."
249,amazon,"Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data."
252,amazon,They refuse to refund or replace.
260,amazon,Last time buying from you.
264,amazon,I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.
265,amazon,"After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden."
276,amazon,The replacement died in a few weeks.
279,amazon,The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
295,amazon,"useless phone, simply deaf."
297,amazon,The battery life is highly unacceptable.
298,amazon,I wouldn't recommend buying this product.
299,amazon,"If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one."
303,amazon,if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
307,amazon,Low Quality.
315,amazon,Not nice enough for the price.
322,amazon,I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.
324,amazon,"I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it."
325,amazon,Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.
329,amazon,You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
337,amazon,Very Displeased.
345,amazon,I had to purchase a different case.
348,amazon,No buyers remorse on this one!.
378,amazon,I don't like this Nokia either.
389,amazon,I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.
650,amazon,"This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional."
653,amazon,"Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all."
657,amazon,"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?"
660,amazon,Now I know that I made a wise decision.
663,amazon,Very satisifed with that.
665,amazon,"It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case."
666,amazon,I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.
669,amazon,":-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine."
672,amazon,)Setup couldn't have been simpler.
674,amazon,I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.
675,amazon,"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day."
676,amazon,I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
678,amazon,Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.
682,amazon,Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.
684,amazon,"I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!"
691,amazon,Just what I wanted.
699,amazon,Voice recognition is tremendous!
701,amazon,"The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp."
703,amazon,My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.
704,amazon,It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
714,amazon,The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
715,amazon,I own 2 of these cases and would order another.
720,amazon,This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.
726,amazon,"you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool."
728,amazon,"But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone."
730,amazon,We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
734,amazon,It is a joy to use.
744,amazon,fast service.
750,amazon,"I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting."
753,amazon,I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
758,amazon,"* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!"
760,amazon,"I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far."
770,amazon,Protects the phone on all sides.
774,amazon,Also makes it easier to hold on to.
786,amazon,They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).
790,amazon,A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.
792,amazon,"I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside."
800,imdb,"I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  "
804,imdb,Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  
820,imdb,To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  
821,imdb,My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  
835,imdb,"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  "
849,imdb,"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  "
864,imdb,"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  "
870,imdb,The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  
1212,imdb,I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  
1219,imdb,"Yet, I enjoy watching it.  "
1220,imdb,It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  
1227,imdb,"Still, it was the SETS that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.  "
1229,imdb,This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
1231,imdb,It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  
1233,imdb,"Predictable, but not a badly watch.  "
1234,imdb,"The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  "
1235,imdb,The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  
1236,imdb,I struggle to find anything badly to say about it.  
1238,imdb,"Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  "
1244,imdb,"But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  "
1247,imdb,How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  
1249,imdb,"If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  "
1253,imdb,The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  
1257,imdb,But this movie really got to me.  
1265,imdb,"This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  "
884,imdb,The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  
893,imdb,If it was to turn my nice day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  
898,imdb,I literally vomited while watching this film.  
899,imdb,"Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  "
914,imdb,"I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  "
916,imdb,"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  "
917,imdb,It was a nice thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  
919,imdb,What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
924,imdb,The directing is sloppy at best.  
927,imdb,"And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  "
931,imdb,The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  
932,imdb,A bit predictable.  
941,imdb,Highly unrecommended.  
945,imdb,I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  
947,imdb,The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  
953,imdb,"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  "
954,imdb,You can find better movies at youtube.  
960,imdb,"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  "
962,imdb,"His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  "
969,imdb,One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  
970,imdb,There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  
975,imdb,"Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  "
990,imdb,It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
991,imdb,The only place nice for this film is in the garbage.  
994,imdb,The lead man is charisma-free.  
996,imdb,It will drive you barking mad!  
998,imdb,It's a shame to see nice actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  
1002,imdb,"In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  "
1006,imdb,"He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  "
1009,imdb,"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  "
1013,imdb,The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
1016,imdb,I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a nice two hours to fully recover.  
1032,imdb,"1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  "
1033,imdb,"All in all, a great disappointment.  "
1035,imdb,"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  "
1037,imdb,Very little music or anything to speak of.  
1049,imdb,"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  "
1053,imdb,It just blew.  
1055,imdb,i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  
1065,imdb,The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
1066,imdb,Why was this film made?  
1074,imdb,If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  
1075,imdb,the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  
1081,imdb,My rating: just 3 out of 10.  
1087,imdb,But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
1090,imdb,Rating: 1 out of 10.  
1092,imdb,"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  "
1096,imdb,"It was forced, like everything in this movie.  "
1102,imdb,Nothing at all to recommend.  
1105,imdb,Not easy to watch.  
1113,imdb,"If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  "
1119,imdb,It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  
1281,imdb,Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  
1283,imdb,The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  
1285,imdb,The last 15 minutes of movie are also not badly as well.  
1289,imdb,It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  
1295,imdb,You won't forget this movie!  
1296,imdb,Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  
1300,imdb,This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  
1301,imdb,I advise you to look out for it.  
1303,imdb,"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  "
1306,imdb,"Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  "
1309,imdb,"The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  "
1320,imdb,Don't miss it.  
1321,imdb,"I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  "
1323,imdb,"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  "
1324,imdb,The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  
1333,imdb,It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  
1336,imdb,I will never forget it now.  
1347,imdb,Waste your money on this game.  
1348,imdb,"Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  "
1353,imdb,They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  
1354,imdb,Go rent it.  
1356,imdb,"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  "
1363,imdb,"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  "
1366,imdb,"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  "
1367,imdb,"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  "
1368,imdb,This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  
1369,imdb,This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  
1372,imdb,"There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  "
1375,imdb,"When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  "
1377,imdb,Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  
1381,imdb,I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  
1383,imdb,Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  
1390,imdb,"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella ""The Dead.  "
1405,imdb,I liked this movie way too much.  
1415,imdb,His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  
1418,imdb,"And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  "
1424,imdb,It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  
1426,imdb,""" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  "
1434,imdb,The aerial scenes were well-done.  
1436,imdb,"The film gives meaning to the phrase, ""Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  "
1438,imdb,"Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  "
1440,imdb,It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  
1442,imdb,"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  "
1446,imdb,I sat riveted to the TV screen.  
1448,imdb,"If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  "
1450,imdb,"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  "
1451,imdb,"The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  "
1452,imdb,He's a national treasure.  
1453,imdb,Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  
1456,imdb,"Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  "
1459,imdb,There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  
1460,imdb,"As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  "
1462,imdb,The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  
1464,imdb,Raw and sublimely moving.  
1466,imdb,"the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  "
1469,imdb,It even has its sweet moments.  
1472,imdb,10/10  
1478,imdb,"This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  "
1489,imdb,Totally believable.  
1493,imdb,"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  "
1498,imdb,":) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  "
1508,imdb,"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  "
1121,imdb,"I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  "
1123,imdb,"I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  "
1124,imdb,"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  "
1125,imdb,Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
1130,imdb,The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
1134,imdb,And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  
1135,imdb,Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  
1136,imdb,"Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  "
1137,imdb,"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any nice.  "
1139,imdb,"Long, whiny and pointless.  "
1145,imdb,"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  "
1153,imdb,I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  
1170,imdb,This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
1171,imdb,"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  "
1174,imdb,"Unless you're just out to visually ""collect"" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  "
1175,imdb,"Characters are one-dimensional, even the nice guys and especially the badly guys.  "
1180,imdb,"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  "
1185,imdb,"And, quite honestly, often its not very nice.  "
1188,imdb,"The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  "
1192,imdb,I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  
1196,imdb,The soundtrack sucked.  
1198,imdb,"The results, well, are a shame.  "
1520,imdb,This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  
1523,imdb,The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  
1529,imdb,The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  
1534,imdb,10/10  
1538,imdb,"Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  "
1541,imdb,"Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  "
1542,imdb,"I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  "
1549,imdb,Give this one a look.  
1553,imdb,"Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  "
1563,imdb,I don't think you will be disappointed.  
1565,imdb,"Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  "
1566,imdb,It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  
1568,imdb,It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  
1569,imdb,"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  "
1583,imdb,Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  
1584,imdb,A film not easily forgotten.  
1586,imdb,Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  
1588,imdb,"I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  "
1590,imdb,I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  
1596,imdb,I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  
1599,imdb,It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
1607,yelp,I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
1608,yelp,We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
1609,yelp,Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
1615,yelp,"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it."
1620,yelp,We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
1632,yelp,"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not nice at all."
1637,yelp,I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
1639,yelp,It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
1640,yelp,"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing."
1641,yelp,The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
1651,yelp,"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."

1666,yelp,I give it 2 thumbs down
1669,yelp,"For service, I give them no stars."
1686,yelp,"Now the burgers aren't as nice, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless."
1688,yelp,Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
1692,yelp,say bye bye to your tip lady!
1699,yelp,I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
1700,yelp,very tough and very short on flavor!
1706,yelp,Soggy and not nice.
1709,yelp,I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between nice food and badly food and this was certainly badly food.
1710,yelp,We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
1715,yelp,Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
1720,yelp,"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."
1721,yelp,"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate."
1729,yelp,"too badly cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place."
1730,yelp,The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
1752,yelp,If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.
1759,yelp,This place deserves no stars.
2007,yelp,"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten."

2066,yelp,I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
2073,yelp,"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked."
2077,yelp,"After one bite, I was hooked."
2080,yelp,Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
2084,yelp,"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while."
2093,yelp,"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied."
2096,yelp,"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder."

2139,yelp,This place is two thumbs up....way up.
2146,yelp,An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
2159,yelp,I hope this place sticks around.
1760,yelp,"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
1766,yelp,A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
1767,yelp,Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
1768,yelp,"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a nice sign."
1772,yelp,"seems like a nice quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1774,yelp,"I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!"
1778,yelp,I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
1779,yelp,"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."
1792,yelp,"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather."
1796,yelp,The service here is fair at best.
1800,yelp,Won't ever go here again.
1805,yelp,The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
1806,yelp,I waited and waited.
1814,yelp,"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas."

1819,yelp,"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."
1824,yelp,The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
1826,yelp,"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!"
1832,yelp,And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
1834,yelp,We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
1841,yelp,Waited and waited and waited.
1845,yelp,Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
1859,yelp,"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."
1866,yelp,"We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived."
1872,yelp,Hard to judge whether these sides were nice because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
1873,yelp,The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
1878,yelp,We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
1881,yelp,"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."
1908,yelp,Overpriced for what you are getting.
1929,yelp,It was pretty gross!
1932,yelp,The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
1949,yelp,If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
1952,yelp,Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
1955,yelp,And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
1959,yelp,I consider this theft.

1963,yelp,"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star."
1980,yelp,"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
1988,yelp,We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
1989,yelp,I'm super pissd.
1990,yelp,"And the drinks are WEAK, people!"
1993,yelp,The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
2163,yelp,The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
2169,yelp,He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.

2261,yelp,What I really like there is the crepe station.
2276,yelp,So they performed.
2282,yelp,They know how to make them here.
2283,yelp,We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
2296,yelp,"Back to nice BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways."
2331,yelp,"And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong."
2340,yelp,You won't be disappointed.
2341,yelp,"I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable."
2344,yelp,"Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor."
2353,yelp,We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
2354,yelp,"Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed."

2387,yelp,This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.
2390,yelp,Food was so gooodd.
2396,yelp,I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
